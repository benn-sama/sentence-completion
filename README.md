# How to run main for the Terminal to work: 
- make main
- make run-main
# Dataset options: 
1.  For casual texting dataset. (A simple, hand-written dataset (text.txt) used to validate that sentence completion logic works properly with short and predictable sentences.)
2.  For book writing dataset. (A full novel text (1661-0.txt, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes) from Project Gutenberg used to train the model on a rich vocabulary and complex structure. This demonstrates how the model performs with large, real-world language data.)
# How it works: 
- Input: (This is chossing between what type of data set you want to use its either 1 or 2)
- You'll then see this:
- Start typing your sentence (Press ESC to quit): (Now you start typing)
- Tip: After typing a word, make sure to enter a space before pressing a prediction number (1â€“3), or the prediction will replace the current word.

# How to make the tests run: 
- make main
- make run-test

# How to clean the code
- make clean
