At midnight, the solitary cat paused before a silent door. 
The door creaked open, revealing darkness and a faint glow. 
The cat stepped forward into darkness, heart steady. 
Curiosity guided the cat through narrow halls, past ancient symbols.
At last, the cat found a hidden door, and stepped beyond quietly.
